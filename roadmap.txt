A simple text file outlining future features and how to get there
-----------------------------------------------------------------

TODO: Put this data into actual issue tracking software

Audio streaming
- Start/Stop recording
- Musicians placed in chain automatically
- Only root musician can start recording (eventually host maybe?)
- Audio recording delayed by 1 second per musician

Put it on DigitalOcean
- Put it on a droplet
- See if it works with friends!

Modifying the chain
- Two lists: audience and musicians; can move participants between lists
- Musicians are not added to the chain automatically
- Need to be able to set musician names
  - Simple: shows name in top-right corner--can edit the field to update name
  - Defaults to a bird or type of tree (probably a bird)
  - Name saved somehow?
  - In the future, we'll let people have profiles with names, and people can
    change their name for the room like in Zoom
- Cannot update chain during recording
- Last musician in chain is considered the mixer

Client-side mixing
- Can only see musicians behind you
- Tooltip about the fact that this only mixes for you (maybe just call it
  "Personal Mixer"?)
- Master output and slider

Allow rejoining stream mid-stream (if you lose your place entirely)
- Need to save metadata in stream chunks--i.e., chunk index

Cedar audience
- Can join in whenever and hear the audio of the room (definitely need
  rejoining mid-stream to be a thing for this)

Future features
- Support multiple channels (stereo+)
- Visualize and allow playback of recordings
- Download recordings
- Lossless audio
- Musician layers/lanes for grouping musicians together
  - Includes server-side mixing of each layer to minimize network data flux
- Possibly put non-audio-streaming data into an RDBMS instead of Redis
- Intercom feature? I really, really hope we don't need this (managing multiple
  input devices sounds like UX hell). But it may be better than using two
  applications for some people
